TODO:

1) Add at user's home page, after login (in the Web app):
  - My events: 2
  - All events: 5  
  
2) Implement patch (partial update, e.g. change title only) in the API

3) Swagger UI -> better title, e.g. "Eventures API"

4) In the API app: a simple ASP.NET Core Web API for the Eventures App
"Softuni - Website" --> change to the GitHub app repo

5) Better error handling in the API, like thhis:
  return NotFound(new { msg = $"Event #{id} not found." });
  
6) API: edit event: check owner on POST

7) API: delete event: check owner on POST

8) Web app: Button [Back to List] -> use the brown background like in the "Delete" page

9) API (Swagger): change https://localhost:44318/index.html -> https://localhost:44318/api/index.html

10) API (Swagger): change https://localhost:44318/api -> show the same as https://localhost:44318/swagger/v1/swagger.json

11) Docs to be here: https://localhost:44318/api/docs/index.html, but redirect the home page to this URL automatically: https://localhost:44318/ --> https://localhost:44318/api/docs

12) Merge API with the main app




[Done] 0) At the home page, anonymous users should see the #count of events.

[Done] 1) GET https://localhost:44318/api/events -> return 
"owner": {
      "firstName": "Mincho",
      "lastName": "Praznikov",
      "id": "0631c18d-b61f-4a77-81f3-b069cafa9571",
      "userName": "mincho",
      "email": "mincho@abv.bg"
}
map entity User -> UserViewModel

[Done] 2) In the Web App -> users should be able to delete only their own events

[Done] 3) In the Web App -> [Delete] should be available only for the event owner
  - Also check in the controllers

[Done] 4) In the Web App -> implement [Edit] button + edit form (similar to create form, but for editing)

[Done] 6) Fix the unit tests for the Web App

[Done] 7) Add unit tests for the Web API

[Done] 8) Add API help page (auto-generated): GET /api -> return JSON endpoints
Example: https://shorturl.nakov.repl.co/api
Web API Help Page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/creating-api-help-pages

9) Add Selenium tests
