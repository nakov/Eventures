TODO:

1) Add at user's home page, after login (in the Web app):
  - My events: 2
  - All events: 5  
  
2) Implement patch (partial update, e.g. change title only) in the API

3) Swagger UI -> better title, e.g. "Eventures API"

4) in the API app: a simple ASP.NET Core Web API for the Eventures App
"Softuni - Website" --> change to the GitHub app repo

5) Better error handling in the API, like thhis:
  return NotFound(new { msg = $"Event #{id} not found." });
  
6) API: edit event: check owner on POST

7) API: delete event: check owner on POST

8) Web app: Button [Back to List] -> use the brown background like in the "Delete" page

9) Merge API with the main app


[Done] 0) At the home page, anonymous users should see the #count of events.

[Done] 1) GET https://localhost:44318/api/events -> return 
"owner": {
      "firstName": "Mincho",
      "lastName": "Praznikov",
      "id": "0631c18d-b61f-4a77-81f3-b069cafa9571",
      "userName": "mincho",
      "email": "mincho@abv.bg"
}
map entity User -> UserViewModel

[Done] 2) In the Web App -> users should be able to delete only their own events

[Done] 3) In the Web App -> [Delete] should be available only for the event owner
  - Also check in the controllers

[Done] 4) In the Web App -> implement [Edit] button + edit form (similar to create form, but for editing)

5) Merge API with the main app

6) Fix the unit tests for the Web App

7) Add unit tests for the Web API

8) Add API help page (auto-generated): GET /api -> return JSON endpoints
Example: https://shorturl.nakov.repl.co/api
Web API Help Page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/creating-api-help-pages

9) Add Selenium tests
